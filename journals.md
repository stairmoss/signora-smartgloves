Project Title: SIGNORA – Smart Glove for Sign Language to Speech Conversion
Total Duration: 19 Hours
Project Type: Assistive Technology
Objective:
To design and develop a smart glove named SIGNORA that converts sign language gestures into spoken voice, helping speech- and hearing-impaired people communicate easily.

Hour 1 – Project Ideation & Problem Identification

Identified the communication gap between sign language users and normal speakers. Studied how sign language relies on finger bending and hand gestures. Decided to create a wearable smart glove that can detect gestures and convert them into speech. Finalized the project name SIGNORA.

Hour 2 – Literature Survey & Research

Researched existing smart gloves and assistive devices. Studied sensors such as flex sensors, accelerometers, and microcontrollers. Observed limitations in existing models like high cost and complexity. Planned a simplified and affordable design.

Hour 3 – System Planning & Workflow Design

Planned the system workflow:

Gesture detection using sensors

Data processing using microcontroller

Gesture-to-text mapping

Text-to-speech output
Decided to design the software first, followed by hardware integration.

Hour 4 – Software Architecture Design

Designed the basic software logic flowchart. Decided how sensor values will be read, processed, and compared with predefined gesture thresholds. Planned modular code structure for flexibility and future upgrades.

Hour 5 – Gesture Mapping Logic

Created a gesture-to-letter/word mapping table. Defined threshold values for different finger positions. Planned combinations of sensor values for basic words like Hello, Yes, No, etc.

Hour 6 – Microcontroller Coding (Initial)

Started writing the base code to:

Read sensor input

Normalize values

Print readings via serial monitor
Tested logic using simulated values.

Hour 7 – Text-to-Speech Integration (Software)

Integrated text-to-speech logic. Programmed the system to convert recognized gestures into audible voice output using a speaker or TTS module.

Hour 8 – Software Debugging

Tested the code for false gesture detection. Adjusted sensitivity values and delay timings. Improved accuracy and reduced noise in readings.

Hour 9 – Hardware Component Selection

Finalized hardware components:

Flex sensors

Microcontroller (Arduino / ESP)

Speaker or buzzer with TTS

Glove base

Jumper wires & power source

Prepared a basic hardware layout.

Hour 10 – Sensor Placement Design

Designed the placement of flex sensors on each finger of the glove. Ensured comfort and flexibility. Marked correct bending points for accurate gesture detection.

Hour 11 – Hardware Assembly (Initial)

Started assembling sensors on the glove. Connected sensors to the microcontroller using jumper wires. Ensured firm connections to avoid loose contacts.

Hour 12 – Circuit Testing

Tested each sensor individually. Checked analog values while bending fingers. Confirmed that sensors are responding correctly.

Hour 13 – Hardware–Software Integration

Uploaded the software to the microcontroller. Connected hardware with the coded system. Verified real-time sensor data processing.

Hour 14 – Gesture Recognition Testing

Tested predefined gestures. Matched sensor values with gesture conditions. Made minor changes in threshold values to improve recognition accuracy.

Hour 15 – Voice Output Testing

Connected the speaker module. Tested spoken output for each recognized gesture. Improved clarity and volume levels.

Hour 16 – Error Correction & Optimization

Identified misreads and repeated voice output issues. Added debounce logic and delay controls. Optimized code for smooth operation.

Hour 17 – Final Hardware Fixing

Secured all components properly on the glove. Organized wiring to improve durability and safety. Ensured wearable comfort.

Hour 18 – Final Demonstration Testing

Performed multiple test runs. Demonstrated real-time conversion of sign language gestures into speech. Confirmed consistent performance.

Hour 19 – Documentation & Conclusion

Prepared documentation including working principle, block diagram, advantages, and applications. Finalized the project successfully.
